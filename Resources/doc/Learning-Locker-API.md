The page details the custom Learning Locker API. This should not be confused with the xAPI as detailed by the xAPI spec https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md

The purpose of this custom API is to provider developers building reporting type tools with a few additional views of the data within an LRS.

### GET - api/v1/query/analytics

Parameters | Type | Description
----|------|----
filters | Object  | Object of key:value objects, where the key denotes the context path and the value is the value to filter with. Values can be string or array.

**Example**
```
{
 “context.contextActivities.grouping.type” : “course”,
 “object.definition.type” : “http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/badge”,
 “context.contextActivities.grouping.tags” : [
        [“foo”, “bar”], 
        “hello”,
        “world”
  ],
 “result.score.raw: [ ‘<>’, 0.6, 0.8]
}
```

This example would look to return data where the grouping is a '_course_', the object definition type is '_badge_' and grouping tags are equal to '_foo_' **or** '_bar_' **and** '_hello_' **and** '_world_'. And where the raw result score is between _0.6_ and _0.8_.
