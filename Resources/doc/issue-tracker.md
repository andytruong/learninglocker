I have installed Learning Locker on my Xampp machine, I have tried to run the Golf and Tetris samples from the Tin Can Prototypes and am getting the following on both samples
'There was a problem communicating with the Learning Record Store, 400 when using statementid or voidedstatementid, the only other parameters allowed are attachments and or formats'

Any help would be appreciated
